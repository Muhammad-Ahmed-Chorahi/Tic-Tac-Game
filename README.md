# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for 2 players.

## Description

The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and achieve a winning pattern (three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) before the opponent does. Players take turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Player 1 is represented by 'X' and Player 2 is represented by 'O'.
- The game checks for win conditions after each move.
- If a player wins, the game declares the winner.
- If the game ends in a draw, it announces the draw.
- Players are prompted to input the box number they want to mark on their turn.

## How to Play

1. Run the executable file.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns marking spaces on the board.
3. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw when the game is over.
